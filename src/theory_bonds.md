Bonds are fixed-income financial instruments. The characteristics of bonds are security, no liquidity issues, income, diversification.

The price of bonds rises when cash rates fall. This is because bonds are locked at a fixed-rate and the owner benefits when official variable cash rates are going lower.
	
Bonds are securities that represent debt. They are issued by governments, companies, or other entities. Basically, they are simpler than equities and less volatile. They mature after a fixed period of time and earn a fixed interest rate.
