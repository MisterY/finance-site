ETFs or Exchange-Traded Funds, as the name implies, are the funds that are traded directly on the stock exchange rather than through a fund manager. To learn more about ETFs in general, see Wikipedia article (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund">link</a>).

ASX has a section on exchange-traded producs ([link](http://www.asx.com.au/products/exchange-traded-products.htm)) 	and ETF courses (<a href="http://www.asx.com.au/resources/etfs-etcs-courses.htm">link</a>).
