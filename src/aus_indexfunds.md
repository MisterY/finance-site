Other fund managers have funds that use the same strategy but Vanguard is the pioneer of the industry and they usually have very low fees compared to other fund managers.

###### ETF - Exchange Traded Funds

Exchange Trated Funds (ETFs) are offered in Australia. They are index funds in a sense that their value follows an index. Yet they are traded on the Stock Exchange, not as a mutual fund. 

The advantage of ETFs is the cost-efficiency and liquidity. As they require very little maintenance, their operating costs are very low.
