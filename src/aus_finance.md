###### Transaction Accounts ######

Transaction accounts in Australia usually charge a monthly fee but the transactions within Australia are not charged for. 

The one transactional account that is currently fee-free is offered by HSBC Bank Australia.

###### Migrant Banking ######

A few banks in Australia offer migrant banking to new migrants. Migrant banking means one can open an account in Australia from overseas and transfer funds to that account. At a later day, after arrival to Australia and upon identification, the funds are available for use. Banks that offer this service are:

- HSBC - as a part of Premier account (<a href="https://www.hsbc.com.au/1/2/hsbcpremier/assistance" target="_blank">link</a>).
- Westpac - migrant banking (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.westpac.com.au/internet/publish.nsf/content/pbit+migrant+banking">link</a>).
