<p>Since I&#39;m not a fan of credit, I&#39;m looking for the credit cards with the 
following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Have grace period (interest free days). Usually (up to) 50 interest-free 
	days, meaning whatever you charge on the credit card THIS month you have to 
	pay before 20th of the NEXT month in order to avoid interest on those 
	purchases. Good for general and grocery shopping as it maintains the 
	shopping list and when you pay the monthly bill you have a feeling of how 
	much you spend on groceries, clothing, and other items.</li>
	<li>No annual fee. I prefer cards that do not charge an annual fee. Nowadays 
	cards are common enough that the cost of issuing a card should be 
	incorporated into other costs.</li>
	<li>Low interest rate. This one depends on the market. Try to find one with 
	lower interest rates than other cards on the market. With budgeting and 
	planning the interest costs can be kept under control. Cards are useful for 
	having funds at hand for higher-amount purchases and longer pay-off but you 
	should be in charge of costs, have a payment plan, etc.</li>
	<li>No charge for overseas payments and transactions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having this in mind, here are some links to the cards that satisfy one or 
more of the above 
conditions...</p>
