Mutual funds are a common investment vehicle nowadays. For many people it 
represents investing. It is easier than picking individual stocks on the market. 
But, over the years the number of mutual funds grew and picking the one you want 
to invest in is becoming increasingly difficult.

The advantage of investing in a mutual fund is that it has a professional 
management. The fund presents a diversification for an investor because it 
invests in multiple company stocks and disperses the risk. Also, the price 
of a mutual fund is usually low and allows owning a share of an expensive 
stock that would otherwise be hardly affordable.

The disadvantages of the mutual funds are almost the same as their 
advantages. Professional management does not necessarily mean your money 
will be better of, although it could. This professional management charges 
you a fee for their services, which eats into your earnings. Risk 
diversification they offer also means gains dispersion from the 
well-performing stocks.

Mutual funds invest in almost all possible investment options.

One of the possible divisions of mutual funds and the one I am using here is the division of mutual funds into:

- [Managed funds](aus_managedfunds.html) (active)
- <a href="aus_indexfunds.html">Index funds</a> (passive)
- <a href="aus_etfs.html">ETFs</a> (passive)
