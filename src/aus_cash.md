Cash or fixed-income investments are a form of investment almost everyone is familiar with. This form of investing represent lending money in return for interest. The common features for these types of investments are that they:

- earn interest, and
- are paid back after a period of time.

Cash or fixed-income investments are considered to be a defensive investment asset class. Read more about asset classes [here](asset_allocation.html). For this reason, common scenarios for this asset class are the following:

- Saving or parking money in the short-term,
- Keep money you don&#39;t want to lose. It is advisable to keep some cash available for emergencies (see some more financial tips [here](investment_tips.html)),
- Saving for a goal or a larger purchase in the future,
- Reduce risk in investment portfolio by earning a fixed income and offering stability in comparison with other forms of investment.

They are further divided into several sub-categories. At the moment I use the division into:

- <a href="aus_termdeposits.html">Term Deposits</a>
