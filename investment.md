* Term deposits - cash, fixed rate
* Bonds - commercial paper, fixed rate
* Shares - commercial paper, can earn dividends
* Mutual funds, index funds, exchange-traded funds - an intermediate investment option into other 
available markets
* CFDs - trading instrument, mostly suitable for short-term bets
* Real estate - property
* Currencies
* Commodities

Other investments, like arts, wine, etc., are not taken into consideration on this site.
